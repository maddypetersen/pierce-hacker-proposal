# The differences between adobe at school and your personal adobe account

If you are in a design/art class you may have had to use adobe. This includes Photoshop, indesign, illustrator, dreamweaver and many others.

When you use one of these apps on the school computers that have adobe creative cloud on it you will be asked to sign in (only select labs have adobe cloud). Your school email (...smail.pcd.edu) can be used to sign up for adobe for free. All you have to do is make an account with your school email. 

The reason it is free is because your school email is connected to a mass server that every student is on that connects to the school itself. Your tuition pays for adobe creative cloud so while on a campus design computer you can use adobe for free. 

But you have to be careful though. Do NOT log in at home with your school account. When you are home you are outside the range of the server on campus and it will upload the server on your personal computer then the school now has access to your personal computer and will mess with restrictions and privileges. So don't do it.

But this does mean that you are unable to work at home or anywhere else with your school adobe account. You can only work on adobe on campus. This means that you will have to come in outside of class to use adobe for free and your professors will say the same thing. If you are unable to make it to the labs outside of class the only option you have left is to use someone else's account or buy your own. 

Also do not save your work on any of the school computers. This is where a flash drive comes in handy. The server that connects all the school computers has a thing called deep freeze. During after hours the computers automatically wipe everything that has been downloaded on it throughout the day. If you save something on a school computer it will not be there tomorrow. 
But there is one thing on the school computers that is safe from deep freeze and that's the M drive. The M drive is used by students to save your work on the school computers if you have nowhere else to save it. A lot of the design classes use it so you will eventually come across it. But at the end of every quarter it gets wiped. A flash drive is highly recommended if you want to go to your work again.

# How to make a new document in Adobe Photoshop for print
1) Click File -> New
2) A screen will pop up with different sized documents you can use. Or you can make your own
3) Make sure the measurements on the right hand side are turned to inches instead of px. If you know your pixel measurements you can skip this step.
4) Make the height 11in and the width 8.5in. This is the size of a normal sheet of paper.
Make sure the resolution is 72 pixels per inch (if you want to upload it to the web) or 300 pixels per inch (if you want a physical copy) unless specified otherwise by a professor. 
5) If you want to print make sure the color says RGB because most printers use that color scheme unless specified otherwise. 
You can also choose the orientation if you want it landscape or portrait
6) Click create
7) You now have a document and can do whatever you want with it. If your new I recommended following the pop up tutorials and taking time to fully mess around with the program.
8) MAKE SURE TO SAVE REGULARLY!!!!!!

## Tip- there is a reason that there are classes for just photoshop. Photoshop is a huge application that can be used in thousands of different ways and gets updated all the time. The creator of photoshop doesn't even fully know all the capabilities of photoshop. Please take the time to mess around and learn all the basic tools before starting on something.
